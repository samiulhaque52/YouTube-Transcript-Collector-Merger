# YouTube Transcript Collector & Merger

This project is a Python-based tool that collects transcripts from YouTube videos and combines them into a single text file.

## What This Project Does

The tool allows you to gather YouTube transcripts in two ways:

### 1. By Channel
- Download transcripts from all videos on a channel
- Or only videos published on or after a chosen date

### 2. By Search
- Search YouTube using a keyword
- Select specific videos or download transcripts from all results

## Smart Transcript Handling

- Downloads official or auto-generated captions when available
- Automatically generates transcripts using speech-to-text (Whisper) when captions do not exist
- Supports batching and delays to avoid rate limits
- Works on Google Colab or local machines


## Why This Is Useful

This project is ideal for:
- Researchers and analysts
- Content creators and marketers
- Journalists and writers
- Anyone needing large-scale YouTube text data

It minimizes cost, reduces manual work, and ensures reliable transcript collection even when subtitles are missing.
